            <p> A deep dive into the CSS Box Model. In this video I look at what the CSS box model is, breaking down margin, padding and borders. It's a bit of a longer video than most in this series as it covers a lot!</p>

    <p>I've been using CSS for a pretty long time and for some reason I never got to know all of the possibilities with text. This was a great refresher on what I did know and a great introduction to the rest. Your videos are fantastic.</p>
    <p>As a recent retiree, I started studying web design as a hobby during lock-down last year. I enjoy its many facets: typography, color theory, programming, layout design, etc.  This stuff will keep me engaged for the rest of my life. Many thanks for your great videos, Kevin !!</p>
    <p>I just finished a grad diploma in tech and am doing a review and extending my skills. The program was a bit of a random buffet of courses instead of one course building on the one before. While it did help me find a direction for my second career, I don't feel ready to apply for jobs quite yet. This video was a nice refresher, and I learned a bit too (text decoration). Going through most of this playlist most mornings this week.</p>
